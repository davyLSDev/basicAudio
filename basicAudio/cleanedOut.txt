The ff was just cleaned out of Program.cs to make it easier to test out the new stuff

/* The following doesn't appear to make any noise, based on: Console.Beep(freq Hz, time ms) (doesn't work in mac or linux)
		 * at least when run from within Xamarin studio */
		Console.Beep (5000, 1000);
		System.Threading.Thread.Sleep (1000);
		Console.Beep (7500, 1000);
		System.Threading.Thread.Sleep (1000);
		Console.Beep (10000, 3000);

		/* This doesn't work either in mac, but it does in linux ... maybe it does work outside of xamarin studio
		 * No, it doesn't */
		/* System.Media.SystemSounds.Beep.Play ();
		System.Threading.Thread.Sleep (1000);
		System.Media.SystemSounds.Beep.Play ();
		System.Threading.Thread.Sleep (2000);
		System.Media.SystemSounds.Beep.Play (); */

		/* temp take this out to see if the Console.Beep works with our Mono:
		// using NSSound idea from: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11593794/easiest-way-to-play-sound-with-mono-on-osx
		// it builds and runs in Xamarin, but it doesn't make any sound
		// when I try to run it from CLI, it crashes ....
		NSApplication.Init ();
		var audio = new NSSound ("../../media/applause_y.wav", byRef: false);
		audio.Play ();
		audio.Dispose ();
